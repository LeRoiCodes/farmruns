## How to Contribute
For Group 17 members, follow this steps to collaborate:

```html

Visit the Repository to the Project on Github Website:
  "https://github.com/LeRoiCodes/farmruns.git"

Fork the repository:
  Click the "Fork" button on the upper right corner of the Repo page.

Make a local clone:
  Click on the "Code" button on the Repo page 
  Copy the URL for the forked Repo
  "https://github.com/LeRoiCodes/farmruns.git"
  Create a Folder on your Local machine / Computer for the project Workspace
  Open Command prompt / Terminal in the same folder location

In your Terminal, type:
  git clone https://github.com/LeRoiCodes/farmruns.git

Open terminal and set upstream branch:
  git remote add upstream https://github.com/LeRoiCodes/farmruns.git

Pull upstream to get up to date with the original repo:
  git pull upstream main

Create a new branch for the task you are working on:
  git checkout -b branchName 
  (Make sure your branchName is descriptive in context to the feature you are working on) 
  (Also be sure to check which branch you are using git status before you begin working)

When you are done with your task, do:
  git add

Commit your work with a message:
 git commit -m "message" 
 (write a message that will make insight on what you pushed)

To avoid conflicts:
  git pull upstream main

Then push your branch:
  git push origin branchName
  This creates the branch remotely and pushes to that branch on the Github

Create a new pull request:
  Go to Github and create a new pull request to the main branch. 
  It will then be reviewed and merged into the master.

```
